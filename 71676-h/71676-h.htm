<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image005b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Edwin</span> was a very tender-hearted
boy, and very eager
about a thing when he took
it into his head; but his
enthusiasm very often left
him just at the time it ought to have remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
with him. Thus he never pursued
any study or amusement for any
length of time with profit to himself, and
often fell into very grievous errors.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear mama,” said he one day
to his mother. “I do so much wish that
I had something for a pet; there is
Charles Jones has a sweet little bird,
and cousin James has a squirrel. I
should so like something for a pet. Do,
mama, buy me something—a Guinea pig,
or a couple of pigeons, or a rabbit. Oh!
I saw such a beautiful white rabbit yesterday.</p>

<p>“Ay, my dear,” said his mama, “I am
afraid you would soon grow tired of your
rabbit, as you did of your gun, and bow
and arrow, and ship, and rocking-horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! but a rabbit is quite different,
mama; you can love a rabbit, you
know, and coax it, and feed it, and make
it happy. I should go out early in the
morning, and pick some nice clover for
it, and some thistle, and dandelion, and
marsh mallows. I know how to feed
rabbits—I have learned all about it. I
must not give them too much green
stuff, but some nice bran and oats; and
then I could make a little trough for it
to eat from, you know; and—and—”</p>

<p>“I am sure, my dear, it would be too
much trouble to you; rabbits require a
great deal of care and attention, and you
so soon get tired of any thing you take
up, that I fear it would soon suffer from
neglect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure I should never <em>neglect</em> it,
mama; and if you will give me a shilling,
I can buy a beauty—a real white French
rabbit, with red eyes, and a coat like
swansdown. Do, mama, give me a
shilling.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” said she, “I really must
refuse you.”</p>

<p>Now, although Edwin was a little boy,
he said to himself, “I know it is only because
mama wished to save her money;
’tis not because she really thinks I shall
neglect the rabbit, but because she does
not like to part with her money.” He
thought himself very cunning? did he
not?</p>

<p>So Edwin began to pout and whine,
and to tease his mama, being determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to let her have no peace. “You know,
mama,” said he, “I shall be so fond of
it; I will make it a house, and then I
could cut down some grass, and dry it,
and make hay for it to lie upon; and I
could sow some oats for it in my garden;
I should not want any thing else to
amuse me all the year round.”</p>

<p>Whether to humor Edwin or to teach
him a lesson, I will not say, but his mama
gave him a shilling, and off he ran, and
purchased the milk-white, red-eyed rabbit
he had so longed for.</p>

<p>Joyful enough was he when he brought
it home; he paraded it round the house,
showed it to every member of the family,
housemaid, laundrymaid, footman, and
cook, and every body praised the rabbit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
as the most beautiful creature they had
ever seen.</p>

<p>The next morning Edwin rose by
times, and began to look for wood to
build his rabbit house. He procured
saw, nails, and hammer; and at last
found some old planks, and began to saw
them, and cut them, and chisel and
plane, till his little arms ached again.</p>

<p>He had soon cut two or three pieces
of board up, but to no purpose; one was
too short, another too long, a third had
a knot in it, and a fourth was spoiled
in splitting. Vexed with his want of
success, Edwin said, “I shall not make
him a house to-night—he must be contented
with being fastened in the coal-hole
to-night, where he will have room plenty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>So bunny was put into the coal-hole,
with a handful of cabbage-leaves, and
told to make himself happy till morning,
and as it happened to be election night,
Edward went to amuse himself by making
bonfires.</p>

<p>In the morning Edwin went to the
coal-hole to look after bunny. There it
was sure enough, but, instead of its being
a beautiful white rabbit—by hopping
about among the coals—it had become
almost as black as the coals themselves.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said the little boy—“what
a dirty little thing it is”, and so
he tried to catch it; but bunny not liking
to be caught, led the youngster a
fine dance in the coal-hole, and at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he fell over a large lump of coal, and
dirtied his clean frill and white pinafore.</p>

<p>It was difficult to say which was the
dirtiest of the two, Edwin or the rabbit.
The little boy, however, being quite
out of patience, made no further effort,
but shut the coal-hole door, and in great
terror ran to the nursery-maid to put
him into cleaner trim. He did not go
again into the place where the rabbit
was that day, and so the poor thing was
kept without food, for Edward totally
forgot that he had not fed his pet.</p>

<p>However, the next day he again repaired
to the place, and having caught
bunny, took it into the stable-yard, and
put it into an unoccupied pig-sty. The
first intention of making a house was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
quite given up, and Edwin began to
think his rabbit was a great plague; he,
however, gave it some more cabbage
leaves, and left it.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image013" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image013.jpg" alt="Edwin with black rabbit">
</figure>
<br>

<p>The fact was, Edwin was getting tired
of his rabbit; he, however, bought it a
few oats, and gave it a little hay. He
went out for a few mornings and gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
a little clover, but in less than a
week this was thought to be a great deal
of trouble; besides which, the rabbit
seemed lame, and did not look so pretty
as it did at first.</p>

<p>At last Edwin quite forgot his rabbit
for two days, and when he went to look
at it he was quite surprised to find it
lying on its side. He called, bunny, bunny.
The poor thing looked at him, and
seemed pleased to see him, for its long
ears moved as if it was.</p>

<p>Edwin took it up; it seemed to have
lost the use of its hind legs; it squeaked
when it was touched; and so the little
boy laid it down again. He felt it all
over—it was very thin, and seemed half
starved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Edwin now ran and got a saucer full
of oats, and placed it beside the poor
thing; he also ran to the next field, and
plucked some nice sow thistle, and gave
it to eat. Bunny looked grateful, and
tried to eat, but could not.</p>

<p>Edwin, in placing his hand down by
its side, felt the beatings of its heart; it
went beat, beat, beat—throb, throb,
throb, quicker than a watch; and every
now and then its head twitched, and the
skin of its jaw drew up, as if it were in
great pain.</p>

<p>And yet the poor animal seemed glad
to have some one by its side, and rubbed
its nose against Edwin’s hand; and then
it panted again, and its eyes grew dim;
it was dying; Edwin now began to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! my poor dear, dear, dear, bunny,”
said he, “what shall I do to make
you well?—oh! what would I give? Oh!
I have killed you, for I know I have.
Oh! my poor, dear bunny—let me kiss
you, dear bunny”—Here the little fellow
stooped down to kiss the rabbit. Just
at that moment it gave a struggle—in
the next it was dead.</p>

<p>Edwin’s eyes were full of tears, and
when he could see through them, and
found out what had happened, he broke
out into loud sobs and cries, till he roused
the whole house. “Oh! my dear rabbit—oh!
I have killed my rabbit—oh!
what shall I do?” he uttered, in deepest
grief.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said his mama, who was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
to the spot by his outcries, “I feared it
would be thus:—who would think a
house-bred rabbit could live in a damp
pig-sty? The poor thing has been destroyed
by neglect.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, dear mama, do not scold me;
I know I have been very naughty. Oh,
I do love my dear rabbit; I love it more
now it is dead than I did when it was
alive; but is it really dead, mama! no,
is it? it is quite warm, and may get well
again,—say it will, there’s a dear, dear
mother,” and then he cried again.</p>

<p>The rabbit was, however, dead; and
had caught its death in the way Edwin’s
mama supposed, by being ill fed and
kept in a damp place, by thoughtless,
if not cruel, <em>neglect</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Edwin was overcome with grief,—but
it was now too late, sad was that night
to him, for something told him that he
had been cruel to that he had promised
to love. He got no sleep; and early in
the morning he arose, and went to the
place where his pet was laid.</p>

<p>He wept all the next day; and, in the
evening, he dug a grave in his own little
garden, close by the side of a young rose
tree. Then he wrapped the body in
some nice hay, and laid it in its narrow
cell, and placed rose leaves upon it, and
covered it gently with the earth; and his
heart was like to burst when he heaped
the mound upon it,—and he was forced
to pause in his task by the full gushing
of his tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“My child,” said his mama, who
watched him at his sorrowful task, “if
you had taken half the trouble for bunny,
when alive, as you do now he is dead,
he would have been alive now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, dear mama,—I know—I
know; but do tell me, pray do—will not
rabbits go to heaven? Is there not some
place where they can be happy? I hope
my poor bunny may!” and here the
little fellow sobbed again.</p>

<p>“Give me a kiss, my dear boy,” said
his mama; come leave this spot: and
so she gently led him away from the rabbit’s
grave.</p>

<h2>JULIA MARTIN.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image020b.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> many of the little
coves and bays
on the coast of
Cornwall, small
villages may be
found—the dwellings
of fishermen,
their wives, and
families. Here, perhaps, they have lived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>from the time they were born, without a
thought or a wish, as far as the land is
concerned, beyond the narrow place in
which they dwell. The sea is the great
object of their cares, for it contains the
means by which they live. By the fish
which they catch in it, they are provided
with meat, drink, and lodging: and too
often is the sea their grave. The poor
men lead a hard and anxious life in their
fishing pursuits; and are often tempted
to risk their lives, rather than give up a
chance, when a favorable shoal of fish
may be expected. The women mostly
spend their time in making and mending
nets, and drying and salting the fish.
Even the children may be always found
employed about fish in some way or other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
The very young make playthings of the
bones; those about ten or eleven assist
their mothers in curing fish; and all,
both old and young, feed, with a relish
never lost, on the finny tribe. It is a
pretty sight, on a fine sunny day, to see
the seine, or net, drawn in on the white
pebbly beach: it contains, perhaps, many
hundreds of fishes, tinted with all the
colors of the rainbow. The various families
to whom the net belongs crowd
down to the shore for their share of the
fish; for, as the net costs a great deal of
money, the price is divided, perhaps, between
half a dozen owners. During the
winter season, should there have been
any failure in the fishing, great hardships
are sometimes felt by these poor people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
The stock of salt fish is done; potatoes
are dear, and money to buy bread is but
scarce. The patience and self-denial
shown under such privations is truly to
be admired, and might furnish a useful
lesson to those whom it had pleased God
to provide, at all seasons, with every
thing that can make life pleasant; and
who are too apt to complain if some of
the lesser means of their enjoyment are
cut off by a hard winter season.</p>

<p>Rosecreay, one of the fishing villages
we have been describing, was fortunate,
during a very severe winter, in having
near it a very charitable lady, who had
taken a house which for many years had
been without an inmate.</p>

<p>Why she remained in a cold and bleak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
spot, so far from London, from whence
she came, her friends often wondered;
and her daughter Julia, when she heard
the wind coming in great gusts up the
valley, or the rain beating against the
windows, as if it insisted on coming in,
would wish she was back again in the
pretty house at Kensington. Mrs. Martin
was not poor, but she was not rich,
and she had taken the old house for
three years, because the rent was very
low; her own house in town she had let,
and the change was made that her only
son, Frederic, might study as a painter.
How many mothers thus deny themselves
comforts, that they may save money for
those dearer to them than their own lives!
How few meet with any reward for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
self-denial! Mrs. Martin was constant
in her visits to the families of the fishermen;
gave them tracts to read; made
clothes for the poor children; and was
always ready, in time of illness, with
medicine for the sick, and soup for those
getting better. She also tried to teach
them cleaner habits; but in this she
failed. Julia soon got tired of going with
her mother to see people who persisted
in having such bad smells in and about
their houses, wondering, at the same
time, that, with water so near, the village
was not kept cleaner; to which an
old woman would sometimes reply, that
fish never smell ill to them. One stormy
day in January, Mrs. Martin and Julia
sat at the window watching the huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
waves that came tumbling in, with, as
Julia said, “great white caps on their
heads.” The fine weather of yesterday,
said Mrs. Martin, I hear, has tempted
poor John Penman to go out fishing, in
spite of his having hardly got rid of the
fever he has so long had. I am afraid
that as he knew that Frederic is coming
we should like some fish to-day. The
weather changed so suddenly in the night,
that I feel quite anxious lest he should
have been lost. Mrs. Martin’s fears were
too well founded, for John Penman, his
eldest son, and another lad, never saw
their homes again: the boat had been
lost during the heavy gale, and all on
board had perished.</p>

<p>How dreadful! said Julia. I wish we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
did not live where we were always hearing
and seeing such disagreeable things.
We must not, my dear Julia, said her
mother, indulge in such selfish feelings;
let us rather think what we can do for
the poor widow and her orphans, whether
it is disagreeable or not. The next morning,
though it was still stormy, Mrs.
Martin set out for the cottage of Mrs.
Penman; and as Julia thought it was
too cold to venture out, she was spared
the sad scene that was seen by Mrs. Martin.
The children were crying round the
bed of their poor mother, where she lay
in too much grief to attend to the kindness
of the neighbors, who crowded round
trying to comfort her.</p>

<p>The room was small and dirty, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
but little furniture in it; but strange to
say, on one side of it hung an old circular
painting, and though it was nearly
black with smoke, Mrs. Martin could see
it was no common picture. With the
hope that it might prove of some use to
the poor woman, she got the eldest boy
to carry it to her house, sending back by
him a basket laden with food for his
desolate home. Frederic had arrived in
due time the night before, and his mother
now begged him to look at the old painting.
Although he had not long been an
artist, he at once saw that it had been
painted by a skilful hand. While cleaning
it from the smoke and dirt, they
found the name of the painter and of the
lady on the canvas. On inquiry, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
also found that John Penman’s father
had saved the picture from a great house,
which had been burnt to the ground
many years ago. Mrs. Martin wrote to
the family to whom the painting had
once belonged, and they were glad to pay
the poor woman, to her great surprise
and joy, a handsome sum of money for it.
She was then able to buy a share in a
net, which her husband had always
been too poor to do, and by it was enabled
to bring up her family in the humble
way to which they had always been
accustomed.</p>

<p>Ah! mother, said Julia, what good
you have been able to do from always
thinking of other people rather than
yourself. I will never grumble again at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the smells of the fishing village, but try,
if I can, to be as useful there as you have
been; and Julia, in spite of the cold and
bleak winter, well kept her promise.</p>

<h2>THE HAYMAKERS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image035.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="drop-cap">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> haymakers are working
blithely, tossing about
the grass, and talking and
laughing right merrily.
This is a holiday, both for
old and young. Many who are employed
in manufactures, with their wives and
children, obtain leave to work in the fields
when hands are scarce; and doing so
seems like a new life to them. You may
see at the further end, hillocks of grass
thrown up in long rows; the haymakers
call them wind-cocks; they are piled
light and high, that the wind may blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
through them; but in this part of the
field people are tossing the hay about.
Gray-headed old men are here, aged women,
and children, seemingly without
number. Their parents are hard at work
and very glad are they to put the “wee
things” in safe keeping among the old
folks, who yet can help a little. Look
at those girls and boys at play—see how
they pelt one another with the hay, and
roll each other over upon the grass—these
are happy days. See those youngsters,
scarcely able to totter, how they
tumble on the sweet, fresh grass; while
those who have strength to handle the
rake mimic the labors of their parents,
and draw tiny loads along the greensward.
Meanwhile the hay is thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
about, and with each returning day comes
the same pleasant labor, till the creaking
of a wagon, lumbering up the hollow-road
from the old farm-house, half way down
the hill, gives the signal, which tells that
the haymaking season is about to close.
A short time elapses, and the creak of
the heavy laden wagon is heard ringing
over the stones. It comes up again for
another load, then lumbers back to the
old farm, where laborers are busily employed
in placing the hay upon a strong
foundation of wattled boughs. Some
tread down the hay; others throw it up
from out the wagon; till at length loud
huzzas, that wake up all the neighboring
echoes, announce that all the hay-stacks
are completed.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> village seems deserted.
No children on the green running
races with each other,
or playing hunt-the-slipper
on the smooth turf. No old men resting
beneath the manorial tree, sunning themselves,
and talking with feeble voices,
like the aged men of Troy, compared by
Homer to grasshoppers; neither is there
the sound of the spinning-wheel by the
open cottage door, with its rustic porch
and clustering hops. All are away to
the harvest-field. Let us go there too.
We are all bidden guests at Farmer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>Drayton’s, and our holiday will pass
merrily among the reapers.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Good morning, Goody! Where are
you going with your troop of rosy children,
all glee and gossip?” “To the harvest-field,
young masters. ’Tis a pleasant
time, that comes but once a year, and
we make the most of it. My master was
out before the sun, reaping in the field
beside the river; but I had to dress the
children and get his dinner, and that
makes me late.” “Good day, then; we
will not hinder you.” Away she goes,
half running, the children out of breath
with delight. They have turned into
Johnson’s field. Let us follow them.
There they are with twenty or thirty
others, gathering the scattered ears, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Ruth gathered them on the plains of
Bethlehem. Look at Goody! How diligently
she is picking up the ears! The
children, too, are all helping. Before the
season is over, they will collect at least
three clear bushels of wheat; and if the
weather prove showery, and the wagon
is hurried to the barn, they will obtain
a larger quantity.</p>

<p>Farmer Johnson is at the farthest end,
watching his reapers. He looks pleased,
and with reason, for the rustling corn
stands thick, and the men work cheerfully.
The Lord of the Field, (for such
the chief reaper is called,) heads the long
line of farming servants. When he
clasps the opposite ears in his strong
arms, they clasp theirs also; when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
thrusts his sickle, they do the same; and
there is presently laid low a wide extent
of grain, with its garniture of flowers,—the
corn-cockle, and scarlet-poppy, sweet
basil, and marjoram, herbs Robert and
Christopher, Cicily and William—names
by which old simplers commemorated
worth or friendship, or the villagers of
other days associated with the memory
of benefactors, whose skill and kindness
might be shadowed forth in the qualities
of their favorite plants. It seems as if
those who bind up the sheaves have
some pleasant or grateful thoughts connected
with the prostrate flower, for a
few are carefully taken from among the
rest and put aside.</p>

<p>Before the young wheat springs up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
we shall hear, I fancy, the church-bells
ringing merrily, for there are John Gray
and Susan Bell hard at work. He has
just pulled the prickly stems of the
woolly thistle from the corn she is about
to bind. Farmer Johnson often tells the
men and women to mind their work;
but he takes no notice of John and Susan,
though many a kindly word passes between
them, for he knows that more industrious
and well-conducted young persons
are no where to be found.</p>
